# GAMP® 5 and Computer System Validation 

## **Introduction:**

- **GAMP® Definition:**
  - GAMP® stands for Good Automated Manufacturing Practice.
  - Introduced in 1991 to address gaps between regulatory expectations and industry practices.
  - GAMP® 5 is the current version, introduced in 2008 by ISPE.

## **Key Concepts of GAMP® 5:**

- Product and process understanding
- Lifecycle approach within a QMS
- Scalable lifecycle activities
- Science-based quality risk management
- Leveraging supplier involvement

## **System Development Lifecycle (SDLC):**

- Four major phases: Concept, Project, Operation, and Retirement.
- Project phase is crucial for validation and system release.
- Each phase involves specific activities like planning, verification, and reporting.

Certainly! Here's the GAMP® 5 Categorization beautified into Markdown format:


## **GAMP® 5 Categorization:**

1. **Infrastructure Software:**
   - Includes operating systems, database engines, middleware, programming languages, and antivirus software.
   - Forms the foundational software infrastructure for computerized systems.

2. **Non-configured Software:**
   - Also known as Commercial Off-The-Shelf (COTS) software.
   - Ready-made software available in the market without configuration.
   - Examples include laboratory software like chromatography systems.

3. **Configured Software:**
   - Involves software that is configured based on specific requirements.
   - Examples include Laboratory Information Management Systems (LIMS), Data Dashboards, and Process Control Systems.

4. **Custom Applications (Bespoke Software):**
   - Internally or externally developed IT applications.
   - Tailored to meet the specific business needs of an organization.
   - Examples include custom-developed pharmaceutical production tracking software.

Note: Category 2 (firmware) from GAMP® 4 was removed in GAMP® 5 and merged with other categories based on the nature of the software.

## **Data Integrity (ALCOA+):**

- Focuses on data accuracy, completeness, legibility, originality, and accessibility.
- Applies to paper, hybrid, and electronic systems.

# GAMP® Assessment Guide for Computerized Systems Validation

A GAMP assessment is a crucial step in the validation process for computerized systems, especially in regulated industries such as pharmaceuticals. The goal is to determine the appropriate level of validation and documentation needed based on the system's impact on product quality and patient safety. Below is a comprehensive guide on what needs to be done as part of a GAMP assessment:

## 1. **Understand the System:**
   - **Scope Definition:**
     - Clearly define the scope of the computerized system, identifying boundaries and interfaces with other systems.

## 2. **Gather Information:**
   - **User Requirements:**
     - Collect and document user requirements, understanding the intended use of the system.
   - **System Functionality:**
     - Document the intended functions of the system and how it will be used in the production process.

## 3. **Categorize the System:**
   - **GAMP Categories:**
     - Use the GAMP categorization framework to classify the system into Categories 1, 3, 4, or 5.
     - Consider the impact on product quality and patient safety when assigning categories.

## 4. **Risk Assessment:**
   - **Perform Risk Analysis:**
     - Conduct a risk assessment to identify potential risks associated with the system.
     - Consider factors such as data integrity, system complexity, criticality, and impact on the final product.
     - Evaluate the likelihood and severity of identified risks.

## 5. **Validation Approach:**
   - **Determine Validation Approach:**
     - Based on categorization and risk assessment, determine the appropriate validation approach.
     - Define the level of documentation and testing required.

## 6. **Documentation:**
   - **Validation Plan:**
     - Develop a validation plan outlining strategy, responsibilities, deliverables, and timelines.
   - **User Requirement Specification (URS):**
     - Develop a URS document stating user requirements for the system.
   - **Functional Specifications:**
     - Create detailed functional specifications describing how the system meets user requirements.
   - **Traceability Matrix:**
     - Develop a traceability matrix to ensure each requirement is traced back to test cases.

## 7. **Testing:**
   - **Test Protocols:**
     - Develop IQ, OQ, and PQ protocols based on the validation approach.
     - Perform thorough testing to verify the system meets specified requirements.

## 8. **Change Control:**
   - **Implement Change Control:**
     - Establish a process to manage modifications to the system after validation.
     - Evaluate changes for their impact on product quality and patient safety.

## 9. **Periodic Review:**
   - **Conduct Periodic Reviews:**
     - Implement a process for periodic reviews to ensure continued validation of the system.
     - Reassess risks and update documentation as needed.

## 10. **Documentation Maintenance:**
   - **Document Maintenance:**
     - Maintain accurate and up-to-date documentation throughout the system's lifecycle.
     - Ensure documentation reflects any changes or updates.

## 11. **Training:**
   - **Training Programs:**
     - Implement training programs for personnel involved in system operation, maintenance, and validation.

## 12. **Supplier Involvement:**
   - **Supplier Assessment:**
     - If applicable, assess and involve suppliers in the validation process, especially for Categories 3 and 5 systems.

## 13. **Compliance with Regulations:**
   - **Adherence to Regulations:**
     - Ensure validation activities adhere to relevant regulations and standards, such as GxP requirements.

## 14. **Audit Trail and Data Integrity:**
   - **Audit Trail Review:**
     - Include an audit trail review as part of the validation process to ensure data integrity.

## 15. **Record Keeping:**
   - **Maintain Records:**
     - Keep detailed records of all validation activities, testing results, and change control processes.

## 16. **Documentation Review:**
   - **External Documentation Review:**
     - Ensure external documentation, such as supplier documentation, is reviewed and considered in the validation process.

## 17. **Continuous Improvement:**
   - **Continuous Monitoring:**
     - Continuously monitor and assess the performance of the validated system.
     - Implement continuous improvement initiatives based on lessons learned.
